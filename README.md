From my understaning, which is still quite limited,

the libaries and framework are not included in the repo,

you will have to install node.js `https://nodejs.org/en`.

node.js will provide the Node Package Manager (npm).

install the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) `` npm install -g @angular/cli ``

i suppose the best route of action would be to run `` ng new test-app ``

and replace the `src` folder.

you might need to install a package or two.

run `` npm start ``

this will create the dev server, open with default browser with o + enter.

if it compiled.
